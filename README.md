# Nocturne

As a humble attempt at answering the age-old question *What's for dinner*,
[Nocturne](http://nocturne.herokuapp.com) is a restaurant discovery app that
retrieves the latest posts from a curated list of food enthusiasts on
Instagram, and visualizes them on a map.

### Supported Cities

Ideally Nocturne would support major cities around the world, however, I don't
know what accounts to follow in which cities. That's why I started with only
four: New York, San Francisco, Toronto, and Vancouver. **Help me** make Nocturne
better by suggesting your favorite accounts on Instagram!

A few things to keep in mind before making a suggestion though:
* The user should take quality photos (that focus on food)
* The user primarily take their photos in one city
* The photos usually have a location associated with them

The following is a list of cities currently supported with their corresponding Instagram accounts:

| City | Accounts
| ---- | --------
| New York | [@new_fork_city](http://instagram.com/new_fork_city/), [@bestfoodny](http://instagram.com/bestfoodny/), [@eatingnyc](http://instagram.com/eatingnyc/)
| San Francisco | [@eatdrinksf](http://instagram.com/eatdrinksf/), [@breakfastinsf](http://instagram.com/breakfastinsf/), [@eatingthroughsf](http://instagram.com/eatingthroughsf/)
| Toronto | [@to_finest](http://instagram.com/to_finest/), [@tastetoronto](http://instagram.com/tastetoronto/), [@tofoodies](http://instagram.com/tofoodies/)
| Vancouver | [@nomnomyvr](http://instagram.com/nomnomyvr/), [@yvreats](http://instagram.com/yvreats/), [@bitesofvancouver](http://instagram.com/bitesofvancouver/)
