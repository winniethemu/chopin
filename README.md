# Nocturne

As a humble attempt at answering the age-old question *What's for dinner*,
[Nocturne](http://nocturne.herokuapp.com) is a restaurant discovery app that
retrieves the latest posts from a curated list of food enthusiasts on
Instagram, and visualizes them on a map.

### Supported Cities

Ideally Nocturne would support major cities around the world, however, I don't
know what accounts to follow in which cities. That's why I started with only
four: New York, San Francisco, Toronto, and Vancouver. **Help me** make Nocturne
better by suggesting your favorite accounts on Instagram!

A few things to check before making a suggestion:
* The user should take quality photos (and focus on food)
* The user primarily take their photos in one city
* The photos usually have a location associated with them (and preferrably not always the same location)

The following is a list of cities currently supported with their corresponding Instagram accounts:

| City | Account
| ____ | _______
| New York | @new_fork_city, @bestfoodny, @eatingnyc
| San Francisco | @eatdrinksf, @breakfastinsf, @eatingthroughsf
| Toronto | @to_finest, @tastetoronto, @tofoodies
| Vancouver | @nomnomyvr, @yvreats, @bitesofvancouver
